# Just The Ticket

This app was created to help would-be developers post their queries in the form of tickets which could be answered by other members of teams or coaches.

Many times questions asked by juniors are vague and do not provide enough information, either for the developer themselves or the person endeavoring to answer the query.

We designed this app in a way that requires the user to fill out in detail their problem, including solutions they have already tried, as well as any error logs.

The two main benefits of this are that, by thinking about their question enough to fill in all the required fields, the user may well reach a solution on their own during the process; if not, the greater detail will enable assistance to be provided quickly and with less time-consuming correspondence.

"If Stack Overflow is MDN Docs, then we're W3schools" - Beginner friendly and encouraging upcoming devs to think in a way that will be useful to them throughout their careers.
